Hello,

Please click the following link to reset your password:
<g:createLink controller="user" action="resetPassword" id="${user.passwordResetKey}" absolute="true"/>

If you did not request that your password be reset, you can safely ignore this email. It's likely that another person has mistakenly attempted to log in using your email. As long as you do not click the link above, no action will be taken and your account will remain secure.
